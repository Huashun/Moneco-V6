It moved to its current location in 2007. It offers a display of over 150 plants of cultural significance to the Koori people of Southern Australia (used for food, medicine and tools). The Garden was designed by Dr Beth Gott from the School of Biological Sciences. The Mullum Mullum Scarred Tree was donated to Monash University in 1999. The scar in the tree was created by the Wurundjeri Balluk people of the Yarra Valley, when they cut the bark to make a shield.  ]]></description>

The plant selection in this garden is of species that tolerate wet conditions as well as hot dry spaces including small collections of She-oaks (Casuarina sp), Paperbarks (Melaleuca sp) and Emu bushes (Eremophila sp). The central focus of the garden is the ephemeral pond or ‘billabong’ that acts as an infiltration basin and water source for birds and frogs. ]]></description>

The exotic garden was permitted against the backdrop of a policy of native only gardens because it was in an enclosed courtyard. The garden features Newton's Apple tree, "Flower of Kent" apple variety. This tree planted in 1975 by Sir Louis Matheson (Monash University's first Vice Chancellor) is a clone from the original tree from which Sir Isaac Newton reportedly observed an apple fall, instigation him to formulate his theories of motion and gravity.   ]]></description>

Australia or for some Rainforest orchids (Thelychiton sp, Sarchochilus sp.), you’ll find them there. ]]></description>
