			<description><![CDATA[Monash University has strong commitment to water conservation.<br>Since 2006 the University has reduced potable water consumption by more than 20%. The main areas of water usage at Monash are domestic use (toilets, showers, hand basins and kitchens), laboratories, cooling towers and grounds irrigation. Savings have been achieved by upgrading plumbing fittings, implementing a permanent water saving strategy and installing innovative rain and storm water harvesting systems. In this Garden the Basin is getting rain water.]]></description>
